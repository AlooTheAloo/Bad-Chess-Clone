A free, open source, peer-to-peer, UDP-KCP (Mirror) based chess game.
Made as a test unity project to learn about high-level networking more than anything lol.

Connect using you friend's IP address. The game uses port 727, so make sure the server has that port open on their router.

Features not implemented (and that I don't plan to implement tbh)
- Castling
- En passant
- Timer
- Server validation
- Game loop
- Matchmaking
